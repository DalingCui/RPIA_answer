Use your best judgement to determine what are the tenor buckets that should be considered in this case.
the tensor buckets can be determined as less than 3 years as short-term, 3-7 years as intermediate term, and larger than 7 years as long-term

1. we may also need to consider the transaction fees and bond liquidity
2. we can use machine learning techniques,such as neural network, random forest tree to enhance the optmizer capability
